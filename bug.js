The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This can happen if you use an asynchronous function to fetch the data, but try to access the data synchronously before the promise resolves. For example, if you fetch data in an event listener, and try to access the data immediately in the same event listener, the snapshot might not have loaded completely yet.
