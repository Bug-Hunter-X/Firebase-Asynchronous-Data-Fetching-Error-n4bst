# Firebase Asynchronous Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching mechanisms.  The issue arises from attempting to access document snapshot properties before the data has fully loaded, often resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.js` file illustrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using Promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations gracefully.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project and replace placeholders in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`.
4. Run the problematic code to observe the error.
5. Run the corrected code to see how the issue is resolved.

## Solution:

Always handle asynchronous Firebase operations with appropriate methods like `.then()` for Promises or `async/await` to ensure that data is available before attempting access.
